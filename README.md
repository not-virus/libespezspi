A simplification of the ESP8266 RTOS SDK's SPI driver API

**NOTE**: This library is still in development and is not ready to use. I've put it up here for the curious.

## About 
The [ESP8266 RTOS SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK)'s SPI driver API can be quite confusing
for beginners and a bit frustrating to work with. This library attempts to simplify SPI communication when
using the ESP8266 RTOS SDK by providing a more familiar and straightforward interface for transmitting and
receiving data. It's worth noting that this library is mostly intended for those who wish to get their hands
dirtier than they would programming the ESP8266 with Arduino, but also don't wish to deal with the full
complexity of the ESP8266 RTOS SDK's SPI driver API.
